<h1>Neutral Tones</h1>
<h2>by Thomas Hardy</h2>
<h3>presented by Jerrod Reed</h3>

<p>
We stood by a pond that winter day,<br>
And the sun was white, as though chidden of God,<br>
And a few leaves lay on the starving sod;<br>
– They had fallen from an ash, and were gray.<br>
</p>
<p>
Your eyes on me were as eyes that rove<br>
Over tedious riddles of years ago;<br>
And some words played between us to and fro<br>
On which lost the more by our love.<br>
</p>
<p>
The smile on your mouth was the deadest thing<br>
Alive enough to have strength to die;<br>
And a grin of bitterness swept thereby<br>
Like an ominous bird a-wing….<br>
</p>
<p>
Since then, keen lessons that love deceives,<br>
And wrings with wrong, have shaped to me<br>
Your face, and the God curst sun, and a tree,<br>
And a pond edged with grayish leaves.<br>
